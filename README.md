# AuraGlyph Design System and Components

AuraGlyph is a next-generation quantum design system that evolves from glassmorphism into a responsive, conscious design organism. This repository contains the design system, React components, and a Vite demo application.

## Project Structure

- **design-system**: Contains the design system documentation and guidelines
- **react-components**: Contains the React components that implement the design system
- **vite-demo**: Contains a demo application that showcases the components

## Features

- ðŸŒŒ Quantum-inspired animations and effects
- ðŸŽ¨ Customizable themes and variants
- ðŸ§¬ State entanglement between components
- ðŸŽ­ Emotional response system
- ðŸ”® Predictive interactions
- âš¡ High-performance animations
- ðŸŽ¯ Accessibility-first design
- ðŸŒ“ Dark mode support
- ðŸ§© Shadcn-based component architecture
- ðŸ”„ Seamless integration with Tailwind CSS

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 16+
- pnpm (recommended) or npm

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/auraglyph.git
cd auraglyph
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pnpm install
```

### Running the Demo

```bash
cd vite-demo
pnpm dev
```

This will start the Vite development server, and you can view the demo at http://localhost:3000.

## Components

AuraGlyph includes the following components:

### Basic Components
- **Button**: Various styles and quantum variants
- **Input**: Text input with quantum effects
- **Card**: Content containers with quantum materials
- **Toggle**: Toggle switches with quantum effects
- **Progress**: Progress indicators with quantum animations

### Advanced Components
- **Modal**: Dialog windows with quantum effects
- **Tabs**: Tab interfaces with quantum transitions
- **Select**: Dropdown selects with quantum styling
- **Alert**: Status alerts with quantum effects
- **Avatar**: User avatars with quantum materials

## Quantum Features

AuraGlyph components include several quantum-inspired features:

### Quantum Materials
- **Glass**: Transparent material with subtle reflections
- **Frost**: Frosted glass with cool tones
- **Nebula**: Cosmic-inspired material with vibrant colors
- **Crystal**: Clear, refractive material with sharp edges

### Quantum Properties
- **Energy**: Controls the intensity of effects
- **Phase**: Determines color shifts and animations
- **Coherence**: Affects clarity and stability
- **Entanglement**: Allows components to respond to each other

### Emotional Response
Components can respond to user interactions with emotional states:
- **Valence**: Positive or negative emotional tone
- **Arousal**: Intensity of emotional response
- **Dominance**: Strength of presence
